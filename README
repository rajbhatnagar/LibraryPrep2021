ANALYSIS AND PLOT CODE

We describe how to reproduce the computational analysis and figures from our paper
Naphade et al "Systematic comparative analysis of strand-specific, cost-effective, RNA-seqlibrary preparation methods for low input samples" (2021)

If you wish to align the reads and generate the read counts from scratch:

	[1] Download FASTQ data from NIH GEO website
		GEO accession number GSE167300

	[2] Download genome reference from Gencode
		Source: https://www.gencodegenes.org/human/release_21.html

	[3] Subsample 10M read pairs per library to remove any effects due to varation in sequencing depth (optional)
	
	[4] Run alignment and generate raw reads 
		Source: https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR
		We used STAR version 2.7.2 with default parameters.

	[5] Filter counts, retaining only those genes with at least 3 counts per million in at least 20% of samples


Alternatively, raw counts are available here at data/counts

To run the main analysis, follow these steps in order.

	[1] Run the DEX analysis and pathway enrichment.
		Command: Rscript src/1_dex_analysis.R
			(all commands should be run from the base directory.)
		This is the main script.  It performs:
			+ count normalization (see output in results/normalized_counts/)
			+ DEX analysis (see output in results/dex/)
			+ pathway enrichment (see output in results/pathways/)

	[2] Generate expression data plots (Figure 3)
		Command: python src/2_plot_expression_sets.py
		See output in fig/expression_sets.  This script makes
			+ pairwise correlations of the regularized counts (Figure 3b)
			+ percentage of reads mapped to ribosomal genes (Figure 3d)

	[3] Generate CDF for differentially expressed genes (Figure 6)
		Command: python src/3_plot_dex.py
		This takes as input data from results/dex/
		See output in fig/dex/.

	[4] Generate pathway enrichment plots (Figure 7)
		Command: python src/4_plot_pathways.py
		This takes as input data from results/dex/
		See output in fig/pathways.

DIRECTORY STRUCTURE AND INPUTS

+ data/counts:
	This contains the raw reads from our alignment.
	LibraryPrep_downsampled_filtered_counts.csv: is the reads matrix, with rows as genes and columns as samples

+ data/metadata:
	LibraryPrep_metadata.csv contains attributes (columns) for each sample (rows)

+ data/kegg:
	Source: MSigDB: http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/downloads.jsp
	This contains pathway defintions, formatted according to MSigDB conventions

+ data/metrics:
	This contains metrics as determined by the STAR aligned and Picard Tools (https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/).

============================================
AUXILIARY FILES

+ dex_lib.R: 
	This is an auxiliary file for running differential expression. It is a simple wrapper around DESeq2.

+ KEGG_pathway_enrichment.R: 
	This is the method for pathway enrichment.  It requires as input DESeq2 results and a set of pathways of interest.
	This method was originally published at: https://github.com/brunetlab/Leeman_et_al_2017/blob/master/kallisto_deseq2/KEGG_pathway_enrichment.R
	See also the Leeman, Hebestreit et al paper where it was first developed.
